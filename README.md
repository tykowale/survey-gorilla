# Survey Gorilla

## Learning Competencies

* Use form controls to pass data into a server application
* Use the MVC pattern in web applications with proper allocation of code and
  responsibilities to each layer
* Implement CRUD in an MVC application
* Use jQuery

## Summary

We're going to build a survey application that lets users create their own
multiple-choice polls and other users to vote in them.

This is going to use a combination of pure JavaScript and AJAX to achieve the
desired effects.

A survey will have many questions.  Each question will have many possible
responses.  A voter will select one (and only one) response for each question
in a survey.

## Releases

### Release 0: Design
Spend a solid design period with your team developing your design and team approach.

#### Wireframes

Create a solid set of wireframes of the pages/ states of pages of your application.  Use a tool like [Balsamiq][balsamiq] or sketch them on paper.

Discuss what your core pages are and what your core user flows are.  There should be two core flows: survey creation and survey
completion.

#### User Stories
Create a solid set of user stories for your application.  Use your wireframes to guide stories (ie what happens when a user clicks here?).

You have two types of users in this application, survey creators and survey takers; build stories for both.

List your user stories in Trello.

#### MVP
Decide what your MVP will be.  Make sure you have wireframes and user stories for all parts of your MVP.

Create a repository for your project. In your repository README include
  * Team name and team members
  * A brief description of your MVP
  * A link to your team Trello board
  * A link to your wireframes
  * A brief description of your team dynamic and git workflow.


###Release 1 : Models

This schema will be fairly complex
and it will help to think in terms of survey-creators versus survey-voters. (You may want to refer back to the polling challenges)

There should be at least 6 core models/tables.  You'll need a table to hold
rows that represent the following sort of facts:

1. User A exists
2. User A created Survey X
3. Question Y belongs to Survey X
4. Possible Choice Z belongs to Question Y
5. User B completed Survey X
6. User B chose Possible Choice Z for Question Y

Each of these should correspond to a single table in your database and a single model in your app.

Users need to be signed in to create a survey and vote in a survey.

Make sure your models support all of your user stories.

### Release 2: Survey Creation

Users will want to create their surveys in "one go" by adding multiple
questions and choices per question on a single page.  This is an opportunity to
create some fun dynamic forms.  Check these out:

* [Adding Form Fields Dynamically with jQuery][]
* [Dynamically Add Input Fields To Form Using jQuery][]
* Google "jquery dynamic form fields" to find more


To start and for your own sanity, maybe limit each survey to a single question.
Create a version with a single question per survey working first and add
support for multiple questions later.

Surveys should also have an optional image associated with them.
[CarrierWave][CarrierWave] is your friend; you'll come to love it with time.

### Release 3: Survey Taking

For now, a user has to answer every question in a survey.  You should be able
to implement this constraint using a single custom validation on a single
model.

### Release 4: Survey Results

Create a nice page that shows the survey creator the results of a survey.  If
you want to do something fancy, try using [d3.js][].  This is
very advanced.

There are other charting libraries like [Flot][] or [Highcharts][].

At the very least, create some simple HTML bar charts by having
percentage-width divs with a fixed height and solid background color so that we
can see how people responded for each question in a particular survey.

### Release 5: Advanced Features

If you're looking for more advanced features, how about something that lets a
user view a survey without logging in but pops up a [modal dialog][] to prompt
a user to sign in/sign up right before they vote?

How about more advanced visualizations, like time series?

How about focusing on making the user interface really nice?

How about multiple question types?
